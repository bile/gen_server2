## gen_server2 - a copy of LSHIFT's gen_server modifications

_gen_server2_ is a modified version of OTP's gen_server behaviour. 
This repository is hosted so people don't have to keep copying the 
gen_server2 source file into their projects, which is pointless unless
you're planning on making modifications of your own.
